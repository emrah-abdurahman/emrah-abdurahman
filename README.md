### A Short(ish) Introduction:
``` js
  console.log("I love Web Design and Web Development!");
```
Hey, I'm Emrah! My passion for web technologies cannot be hidden. I am on a neverending quest to gain more knowledge, skills, 
and experience to level up in this field. Web design and web development allow me to blend an infinite amount of 
creativity with logical problem solving. I am using GitHub to document my journey learning web design, development, 
and possibly other miscellaneous subjects. I am highly open-minded and would love to work with others on collaboration 
projects.
